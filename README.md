To run this game, all you need is a browser.

Double-click on the index.html file and the game
will open up in a browser. To play, you simply need
to use the arrow keys on the keyboard to navigate your
character from the grass tiles to the water, while avoiding
the bug enemies that approach from the sides of the screen at
varying speeds. Once you reach the water, you get a point, and
your score is displayed at the top of the screen and your character
resets. If you get hit by a bug, you reset without earning points.
